# BUGS

OCT 11 2016 - Kivy 
error found after ca. 12 hours run time:
repeated forever, program stalls:

 Exception ignored in: 'kivy.graphics.context.Context.dealloc_vbo'
 OverflowError: signed integer is greater than maximum
 Exception ignored in: 'kivy.graphics.context.Context.dealloc_vertexbatch'
 OverflowError: signed integer is greater than maximum





# Features / todos

FIXED
1. Fix narrow generator (ie determine if there is a datatype error, or
if the neural net is weak AF)
Problem(s) were: 
A. It appears that in practice, arbitrary combinations of DCT
coeficients from inside std. dev. range are not necessarily 0-255.
Soltution - clamp output values.
B. Not totally clear, but some values were float32 and some
uint8. nolearn net takes float32 so changed all dtypes

FIXED
2. Fix output to .pkl (mutable object problem?)
Save images to .png with PIL


3. Add gradient descent on images 

4. make siftgen actually exhaustive

5. implement a system that guarantees unique image feeds across
multiple instances/runs of the program.

6. kivy over buffer error
