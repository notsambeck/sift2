OCT 11 2016 - Kivy 
error found after ca. 12 hours run time:
repeated forever, program stalls:

 Exception ignored in: 'kivy.graphics.context.Context.dealloc_vbo'
 OverflowError: signed integer is greater than maximum
 Exception ignored in: 'kivy.graphics.context.Context.dealloc_vertexbatch'
 OverflowError: signed integer is greater than maximum





# Features / todos

1. Fix narrow generator (ie determine if there is a datatype error, or
if the neural net is weak AF)

2. Fix output to .pkl (mutable object problem?)

3. Add gradient descent on images 

4. make siftgen actually exhaustive

5. implement a system that guarantees unique image feeds across
multiple instances/runs of the program.
